# Hypothesis Testing on Electric Car Usage Rates for Autolib

This analysis demonstrates the hypothesis testing process on a data science project.

Some of the techniques discussed include univariate and bivariate data analysis, sampling approach, null and alternate hypotheses as well as test statistics.

# Project Description

Autolib was an electric car sharing service company in France that was operational between 2011 and 2018. The company had three types of electric cars i.e blue cars, Utilib cars and Utilib 1.4 cars. Blue cars were most popularly used. These cars were available across various cities and postal codes in France and renters could pick up cars in one station then drop them off at a different station that was closer to their destination.

For purposes of this project, I decided to focus on two cities i.e Paris (department # 75) and Hauts-de-Seine (department # 92). Out of the cities provided in the dataset these cities are the two most densely populated. Even though Hauts-de-Seine is larger than Paris in terms of total area in square kilometers, Paris is more densely populated and more popular with tourists. As such, I suspect that the average blue car usage rates are higher in Paris relative to Hauts-de-Seine city. This is the hypothesis I would like to test. Usage rates are generally higher during the weekends therefore the analysis focuses on this time period.

Null Hypothesis: The average number of blue cars picked up on weekends in Paris is less than or equal to those picked up in Hauts-de-Seine on weekends.

Ho : μ1 </= μ2 (where μ1 is mean for Paris and μ2 is mean for Hauts-de-Seine)

Alternate Hypothesis: The average number of blue cars picked up during the weekend is higher in Paris compared to the same average in Hauts-de-Seine.

Ha : μ1 > μ2
